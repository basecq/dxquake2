This is conversion of popular Quake 2 engine to work with DirectX v9. This project aims to write only dx refresh module (ref\_dx), so there shouldn't be any changes to original Quake 2 code. This means also that there wouldn't be any benefit from using DirectX 9 architecture. It's only a simple port to DX9.
